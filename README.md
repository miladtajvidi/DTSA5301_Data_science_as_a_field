# DTSA5301_Data_science_as_a_field

This repository contains the final project for DTSA 5301 : Data Science as a Field as part of the Master of Science in Data Science at University of Colorado, Boulder.
This repository contains two R markdown files, COVID_19 and NYPD.

Note: Due to some libraries incompatibilities on my end, I had to include one of the plots, namely perp_race_plot as an external html which will be rendered in the NYPD markdown file . For knitting the NYPD.rmd file successfully, you just need to download the perp_race_plot.html and put it in the same directory as NYPD.rmd .
